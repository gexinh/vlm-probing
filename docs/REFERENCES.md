# Papers and Datasets

[Home](../README.md) / [Documentation](README.md)

This index separates method sources, reusable primitives, and the datasets used
by demonstrations or lens calibration. A paper reference identifies the
computation being implemented; the scope column records what this library
actually exposes. One- or two-case demos do not reproduce dataset-level claims.

| [EmbedLens](methods/embed_lens.md) | Fan et al., CVPR 2026, [What Do Visual Tokens Really Encode? Uncovering Sparsity and Redundancy in Multimodal Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2603.00510). [Code](https://github.com/EIT-NLP/EmbedLens) | Cosine neighbors of projected visual tokens in the language input-embedding table. No automatic sink/dead/alive classification or pruning benchmark. |
| [Patchscopes](methods/patchscope.md) | Ghandeharioun et al., ICML 2024, [Patchscopes: A Unifying Framework for Inspecting Hidden Representations of Language Models](https://proceedings.mlr.press/v235/ghandeharioun24a.html).

## Attention methods

| Method | Original work and author implementation | Implemented scope |
| --- | --- | --- |
| [Rollout](methods/attention_rollout.md) | Abnar and Zuidema, ACL 2020, [Quantifying Attention Flow in Transformers](https://aclanthology.org/2020.acl-main.385/). [Code](https://github.com/samiraabnar/attention_flow) | Residual-aware row-normalized self-attention transitions. Attention flow/max-flow is not implemented. |
| [Attention Grad-CAM](methods/attention_maps.md) | Selvaraju et al., ICCV 2017, [Grad-CAM: Visual Explanations from Deep Networks via Gradient-Based Localization](https://arxiv.org/abs/1610.02391). [Author ViT attention adaptation](https://github.com/hila-chefer/Transformer-Explainability) | Attention heads serve as channels. This is an attention-map adaptation, not the original CNN feature-map algorithm. |
| [ATTATTR](methods/attention_maps.md) | Hao et al., AAAI 2021, [Self-Attention Attribution: Interpreting Information Interactions Inside Transformer](https://arxiv.org/abs/2004.11207). [Code](https://github.com/YRdddream/attattr) | Independent per-layer probability-space integrated gradients, keeping the model input fixed. |
| [TAM](methods/attention_maps.md) | Yuan et al., NeurIPS 2021 XAI4Debugging workshop, [Explaining Information Flow Inside Vision Transformers Using Markov Chain](https://xai4debugging.github.io/files/papers/explaining_information_flow_in.pdf).

| [Generic relevance](methods/attention_relevance.md) | Chefer et al., ICCV 2021, [Generic Attention-model Explainability for Interpreting Bi-Modal and Encoder-Decoder Transformers](https://arxiv.org/abs/2103.15679). [Code](https://github.com/hila-chefer/Transformer-MM-Explainability) | Positive-gradient self-attention recurrence. Full encoder-decoder/cross-modal relevance propagation is not claimed. |
| [DTD/LRP](methods/chefer_lrp.md) | Chefer et al., CVPR 2021, [Transformer Interpretability Beyond Attention Visualization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2012.09838). [Code](https://github.com/hila-chefer/Transformer-Explainability) | Genuine author relevance-propagation backend for eligible ViT classifiers. It is separate from generic relevance and unavailable on native VLM decoders. |

The original ATTATTR study uses text/BERT; TAM uses image classification.
Decoder-side VLM examples are explicitly method transfers. Individual guides
record paper-versus-code integration rules and required hook sites.

## Causal methods

| Method | Original work and author implementation | Implemented scope |
| --- | --- | --- |
| [Activation patching](methods/activation_patching.md) | A general intervention; Meng et al., NeurIPS 2022, [Locating and Editing Factual Associations in GPT](https://arxiv.org/abs/2202.05262) is a causal-tracing application. [ROME code](https://github.com/kmeng01/rome) | Aligned residual replacement and measured output-score changes. No ROME editing algorithm or complete causal-tracing benchmark. |
| [IOI-style path patching](methods/path_patching.md) | Wang et al., ICLR 2023, [Interpretability in the Wild: A Circuit for Indirect Object Identification in GPT-2 Small](https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.00593), Appendix B. [Pinned author code](https://github.com/redwoodresearch/Easy-Transformer/blob/ea15315dd24481e9e2ac5c3ef335d82907a1dc34/easy_transformer/ioi_utils.py#L985-L1133) | Four actual forwards: base/reference caches, controlled head-output freeze, then receiver-only replay. It tests chosen paths; it does not automatically assign functional head names or discover the entire IOI circuit. |
| [Attribution patching](methods/attribution_patching.md) | Nanda (2023), [Attribution Patching: Activation Patching at Industrial Scale](https://www.neelnanda.io/mechanistic-interpretability/attribution-patching) | Receiver-side gradient times source-minus-receiver activation; a local approximation to replacement effects. |
| [EAP / EAP-IG](methods/eap_ig.md) | Hanna et al., COLM 2024, [Have Faith in Faithfulness: Going Beyond Circuit Overlap When Finding Model Mechanisms](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.17806). [Code](https://github.com/hannamw/EAP-IG) | Original input-embedding interpolation on an audited GPT-2 residual-message graph, with EAP scores and actual circuit recovery. Caller-defined activation-space interpolation is a separately labeled variant. |
| [Attention Knockout](methods/attention_knockout.md) | Zhang et al., CVPR 2025, [Cross-modal Information Flow in Multimodal Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.18620). [Code and GQA subset](https://github.com/FightingFighting/cross-modal-information-flow-in-MLLM) | Editable pre-softmax masking of selected key-to-query routes, including joint layer windows. |
| [Residual steering / VSV](methods/steering.md) | Li et al., ICML 2025, [The Hidden Life of Tokens: Reducing Hallucination of Large Vision-Language Models via Visual Information Steering](https://proceedings.mlr.press/v267/li25ca.html). [VISTA code](https://github.com/LzVv123456/VISTA) | Generic residual-direction injection plus per-image contrastive directions following the paper's residual formula. SLA is not implemented; demos are VSV-only, not complete VISTA. |

Path patching follows the paper's head-output freeze rule. The released IOI code
instead freezes Q/K/V after caching receiver inputs; the distinction is recorded
in [the method guide](methods/path_patching.md). EAP-IG offers left endpoint
sampling matching the released code and right endpoints matching paper Eq. 3.

## Supporting primitives

[Attention profile](methods/attention_profile.md) provides entropy,
concentration, and token-group mass. Related visual-attention applications
include [VAR](https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.03321) and
[OPERA](https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.17911); neither full decoding algorithm is
implemented here.

[Head logit attribution](methods/head_logit_attribution.md) uses a fixed
normalization scale and vocabulary projection, with background in
[A Mathematical Framework for Transformer Circuits](https://transformer-circuits.pub/2021/framework/index.html).
It is not a trained Attention Lens.

[Probability reweighting](methods/attention_reweight.md) and
[attention temperature](methods/attention_temperature.md) are generic
interventions with no unique originating paper. Reweighting post-softmax
probabilities is not [PAI](https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.21771), whose attention
component edits pre-softmax scores and whose full algorithm adds contrastive
decoding.

The demo records the published example source rather than claiming a full VRUBench download. |

Only the small input images and compact measured snapshots needed by the demos
are included in the repository. [Demo provenance](../demos/README.md) and
the image notices identify sample IDs and sources. Complete datasets, model
weights, and fitted probe artifacts remain external. The
[training guide](TRAINING.md) records calibration sizes and split requirements.
